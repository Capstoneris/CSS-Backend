# German Capstone Project 2020
## Capturis Session Share - Backend

## âœ¨ Overview
> Collaborative form editor, chat system, and feedback tool.

## Running the Project

### docker-compose
If you want to use docker-compose to run the backend server and database, you need to configure the following things:
* Install docker (https://docs.docker.com/) and make sure you can run the "hello-world" image
* (if on Linux) Install docker-compose
* Create and add a GitHub Personal Access Token for Docker
    * Log into your GitHub Account
    * Open https://github.com/settings/tokens
    * Select "Generate new Token"
    * Select "read:packages" as scope
    * Add a speaking Note for the Token ("Docker" for example)
    * Click on "Generate token"
* Use docker login to get access to GitHub-Packages
    * `docker login docker.pkg.github.com`
    * Enter your GitHub username as Username
    * Enter the generated private access token as password

After that clone and navigate into the backend server repository in a terminal and execute
```
docker-compose up
```

### In your terminal:
```
    // To run server locally on port 8080
    mvn clean test //<-- the test command is optional, though recommended
    mvn exec:java


    // If you want to run via Docker Image
    docker build . -t css-backend
    docker run -p 8081:8081 --name backend-testrun --rm -it css-backend


    // To run Angular web client on port 4200
    // Navigate to the frontend repository
    npm install // <-- do this to make sure all Node.js packages are up to date
    ng serve -o
```

- Visit localhost:4200 in your browser.

## For development

### Database

You can use Docker for the database, which will automatically be configured as needed.
Do do that, follow the configuration steps:
* Install docker (https://docs.docker.com/) and make sure you can run the "hello-world" image
* Create and add a GitHub Personal Access Token for Docker
    * Log into your GitHub Account
    * Open https://github.com/settings/tokens
    * Select "Generate new Token"
    * Select "read:packages" as scope
    * Add a speaking Note for the Token ("Docker" for example)
    * Click on "Generate token"
* Use docker login to get access to GitHub-Packages
    * `docker login docker.pkg.github.com`
    * Enter your GitHub username as Username
    * Enter the generated private access token as password

After that you can execute

`docker run --name css-database -p 5432:5432 --rm docker.pkg.github.com/capstoneris/css-backend/css-database:latest`

in your terminal to start the database.
